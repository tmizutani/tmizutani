Hi I'm Thiago Mizutani, Brazilian, 34 years.

Over 13 years of experience as a Software Developer, specialized in software engineering, I
have worked in one of the biggest companies in Brazil (Itautec) focused in softwares for retail
and payment systems. During this time I had the opportunity to be part of and collaborate with
different projects like Self Checkout and Fast Food Systems, ETF PoS, and many other solutions
for retail. I am a very compromised person, self-taught, logical thinking, communicative, and
problem-solving, focused on the best results and user experience, always applying the best
practices.
